This is a few lines of text in this file as an example of things I can do
with git 

This is another paragraph of text, below the first one I have created.
This is to see how git works with updating this version to the previous one.

Now I am adding a third paragraph. There is no new or useful information 
in this paragraph. I just want to have more words so that I can edit it
at some other point using git.
